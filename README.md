## Description of the Project
**Tl;dr Shareable: a community-driven financial data platform leveraged by blockchain with a reward-based system determined by community participation.**

Shareable is a community-driven financial data platform with the purpose of incentivizing anyone to share their financial information. The platform will have the native token called "Share" which can be used to subscription the platform or rewarded to the users sharing the valuable information. The entry price will be around 110 HKD (14 USD) which can be determined by the price oracle. The users will then can access and write the article, and also upvote for their favorable post. The reward will be calculated by dividing the daily number of upvotes for a specific post by the daily total number of upvotes, multiped by 0.1% of the token's total supply, and sent to the author of that article. This reward mechanic will incentivize users to contribute the information, which drive the value of the token, and, in turn, drive the incentivize even more. This process will create a sustainable incentivized mechanism.


## 3 Most Impactful Features of the Project

1. Crowd-Source Data Service
   Anyone can contribute or share the financial data platform with a focus on accessibility and anonymity to increase the capacity of sharing network.

2. Native Platform Token
   The platform will have its own token value which has a utility for subscribing to the platform and rewarding the users who share valuable information.
   Consequently, the value of the token will be driven by the value of the information itself, creating a demand for a subscription.

3. On-chain Verification
   The platform will also provide a tampered-proof functionality by utilizing hashing(SHA256) algorithm and comparing with the hash of the data that has been stored on the   
   blockchain
