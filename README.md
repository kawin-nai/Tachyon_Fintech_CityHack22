## Description of the Project
**TL;DR Shareable: a community-driven financial data platform leveraged by blockchain with a reward-based system determined by community participation.**

Shareable is a community-driven financial data platform with the purpose of incentivizing anyone to share their financial data and news. The platform will have a native token called "Share" which can be used to subscribe to the platform or reward users who share their valuable information. The entry price will be around 110 HKD (14 USD) which can be determined by the price oracle. The users will then be able to access and write articles, and also upvote for their favorable post. The reward will be calculated by dividing the daily number of upvotes from a specific post by the daily total number of upvotes, multiplied by 0.1% of the token's total supply, and sent to the author of that article. This reward mechanism incentivizes users to contribute information to our platform, which will drive the value of the token, and, in turn, further increasing the incentives. This process will create an engaging, self-sustained community.


## 3 Most Impactful Features of the Project

2. Native Platform Token
   
   The platform will have its own token which can be used for subscribing to the platform and rewarding the users who share their valuable information.
   Consequently, the value of the token will be driven by the value of the information itself, creating a demand for a subscription.

3. On-chain Verification
   
   The platform will also provide a tamper-proof functionality by utilizing hashing (SHA256) algorithm and comparing with the hash of the data that has been stored on the   
   blockchain.
